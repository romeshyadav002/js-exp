Q: What is async?
A: Async is a keyword that is used before a function to create a async function.


Async await vs Promise.then/.catch
What one should use? async-await is just a syntactic sugar around promise. Behind the scene async-await is just
promise. So both are same, it's just async-await is new way of writing code. async-await solves few of the short-
coming of Promise like Promise Chaining. async-await also increases the readability. So sort of it is always advisable
to use async-await.
