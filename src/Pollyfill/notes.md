# A polyfill in JavaScript is a piece of code (usually written in JavaScript) that provides modern functionality in older browsers that do not natively support it. It "fills in the gap" by emulating missing features.

* When to Use a Polyfill?
    When you need to support older browsers.
    When modern JavaScript features are missing in certain environments.
    To ensure cross-browser compatibility.

* Alternative:
Instead of writing polyfills manually, you can use libraries like:

    Core-js (widely used for ES6+ polyfills)
    Babel (for transpiling and adding polyfills automatically)

Example:
Suppose you want to use Array.prototype.includes(), which is not available in older browsers. You can use a polyfill like this:

if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function (element) {
    return this.indexOf(element) !== -1;
  };
}

Now, even older browsers that do not support includes() natively will be able to use this functionality.
